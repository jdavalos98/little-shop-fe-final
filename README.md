# Little Shop - Coupon Codes | Final Project | Frontend Repo
 

### Contributors: jdavalos98

### Abstract:
This project is a full-stack application designed to help manage and display coupon data for merchants. The application provides a user interface where users can view all coupons associated with a specific merchant. By integrating a Rails API backend with a vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML frontend (built with Vite), this app makes it easy to browse, filter, and view detailed coupon information. It solves the problem of displaying coupon data dynamically in a user-friendly interface, helping merchants and users manage promotional data efficiently.

### Installation Instructions:
1. clone down both front and backend repos
2. Navigate to the backend directory
3. Run bundle install
4. rails db:{create,migrate,seed}
5. run rails s
6. Navigate to your frontend repo
7. run nvm install
8. run nvm test dev
9. Now you can play around in the front end repo and postman requests


### Context:
This project was completed over several weeks and involved setting up a fully functional Rails API, integrating it with a JavaScript frontend, and displaying merchant coupon data dynamically. My contributions include implementing the coupon endpoints in the backend and ensuring that they integrate smoothly with the frontend to allow for easy coupon viewing and filtering.

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals of this project were to:

	•	Build a Rails API with RESTful CRUD functionality.
	•	Implement conditional logic and filtering for merchant-specific coupon data.
	•	Integrate a vanilla JavaScript frontend with the Rails API backend.
	•	Utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a cohesive user interface.
	•	Gain experience with Vite as a frontend build tool.
